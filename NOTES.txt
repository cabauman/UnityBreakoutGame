Game Dev Notes

・ A splash screen.
・ A main menu with a New Game, Continue, Load Game, Settings, Quit buttons, with game version.
・ Use an image for the game title on the splash screen and main menu.
・ Add audio/video settings (music/effects volume/mute, full screen/windowed)
・ Add controller/keyboard/mouse support.
・ Add button/key indicators that switch between controller/keyboard/mouse use.
・ Add button/key re-binding support.
・ Add "reset to default" settings support.
・ Make sure to save any settings changed and reload them when the game is restarted.
・ Add localization support. Add 3 languages: Mixed-case English, lower-case English, ALL-UPPER-CASE ENGLISH. Add support for updating localized images (remember the game title image above?)
・ When new game is pressed, enter the game that has 3 buttons: Win, Lose, Add 1 Point. Show the Score (points) somewhere on the screen.
・ Support Esc with options to: Load, Save, Return to Game, Quit Game. Provide Save slots and save the game state (score). Loading a game should restore the saved state.
・ Have a win screen!
・ Have a lose screen :(
・ Data download flow at start (can you update localized text by downloading data only).
・ Data hotfix flow (can you update 1 Point to 2 Points (or more) while the game is running?).
・ Fill in the obvious functionality not mentioned here (confirm quit game, continue would require an auto save, validate save game data, etc.).
・ You don't have to implement everything at once. Break it into smaller tasks first, but code in a way that will let you add the rest later.
・ Make sure there are ZERO bugs and all features work as YOU would expect as a player.

# Brick Breaker Game Design

Core Gameplay
- Player controls a paddle at the bottom of the screen
  - Mouse: horizontal movement
  - Mouse click: launch balls attached to paddle
- Ball bounces around the screen, breaking bricks at the top
- Player must prevent the ball from falling off the bottom of the screen
- Power-ups occasionally drop from destroyed bricks
- Player starts with 3 lives
- Lose a life if
  - no more balls remain in play (they all fell off bottom of screen)
  - paddle is hit by a falling hazard
- Lose condition: lose all lives
- Level win condition: destroy all bricks
- Level completion is timed
- Ball-paddle collision angle depends on where the ball hits the paddle
  - Hitting near paddle edges results in a sharper bounce angle in that direction
  - Hitting near paddle center results in more vertical bounce angle

Game Modes
- Classic
  - start from level 1, progress through levels sequentially
  - complete all levels to win the game
- Level Select
  - choose any unlocked level to play
  - try to beat your best time on each level

Brick Types
- Standard Brick: breaks with one hit
- Strong Brick: takes two hits to break (changes color after first hit)
- Unbreakable Brick: cannot be destroyed, acts as an obstacle
- Hazard Brick: breaks with one hit, but drops a falling hazard when destroyed
- Moving Brick: moves horizontally back and forth, breaks with one hit
- Exploding Brick: breaks with one hit, destroys adjacent bricks when broken
- Resizing Brick: scales up and down horizontally, breaks with one hit
- Bottom Armor Brick: only breaks when hit from the top, otherwise acts as an unbreakable brick
- Treadmill Brick: moves the ball in a specific horizontal direction when hit, unbreakable brick

Power-Ups
- Expand Paddle: increases paddle width for a limited time
- Shrink Paddle: decreases paddle width for a limited time
- Multi-Ball: splits the ball into multiple balls
- Extra Life: grants an additional life
- Sticky Paddle: ball sticks to paddle on contact, allowing player to aim next shot
- Projectile: paddle shoots projectile straight up upon each ball contact (destroys breakable bricks)
- Reverse Bounce: reverse ball's normal horizontal bounce direction upon hitting the paddle
- Heavy Ball: ball breaks through all bricks in its path

Future Ideas
- Ability to save and load classic mode progress (can only save between levels)
- In-game Level Editor
- Online Unity Services e.g. leaderboards, achievements, cloud saves, dlc
- Classic Mode: add scoring that gets accumulated through the levels based on
  - time taken to complete level
  - number of lives lost
  - possibly for each brick destroyed
  - add high score tracking
- Level Select Mode: display best times on level select
- Score Multiplier: increases points earned for a limited time
- Power-Up Stacking: multiple power-ups can be active simultaneously, with their effects stacking
- Power-Up Duration: power-ups last for a set duration (e.g., 10 seconds)
- Power-Up Indicators: visual indicators show which power-ups are active and their remaining duration
